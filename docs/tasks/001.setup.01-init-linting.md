# 001.setup.01: Initialize Linting and Pre-Commit Hooks

**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** High

## Objective

Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Husky pre-commit hooks for this project.

- Includes jsx-a11y for accessibility and semantic HTML enforcement (React projects)
- Establishes foundation for testable code per CLAUDE.md Web App Testability Standards

## Context

Every project needs consistent linting and formatting to maintain code quality and catch issues early. This task sets up the standard linting configuration.

For web apps, linting also enforces semantic HTML which improves both accessibility and automated testability with tools like `puppet`.

## Technical Details

### Skill to Use

Use the `dev-init-linting` skill which will:

1. Auto-detect project type (React vs Node)
2. Copy ESLint and Prettier configs from templates
3. Set up Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit hooks
4. Install all dependencies
5. Add npm scripts to package.json

### Prerequisites

- Project must have `package.json` (run `npm init` first if needed)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ESLint config exists (`eslint.config.mjs`)
- [ ] Prettier config exists (`.prettierrc.json`)
- [ ] Husky is initialized (`.husky/` directory)
- [ ] Pre-commit hook runs lint-staged
- [ ] `npm run lint` works
- [ ] `npm run format` works
- [ ] jsx-a11y plugin configured (React projects only)
- [ ] `data-testid` naming convention documented in README (web apps only)

## Testing

Run these commands to verify:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm run type-check
```
