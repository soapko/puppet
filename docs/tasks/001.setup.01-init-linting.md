# 001.setup.01: Initialize Linting and Pre-Commit Hooks

**Status:** Pending
**Priority:** High

## Objective

Set up ESLint, Prettier, and Husky pre-commit hooks for this project.

## Context

Every project needs consistent linting and formatting to maintain code quality and catch issues early. This task sets up the standard linting configuration.

## Technical Details

### Skill to Use

Use the `dev-init-linting` skill which will:
1. Auto-detect project type (React vs Node)
2. Copy ESLint and Prettier configs from templates
3. Set up Husky + lint-staged for pre-commit hooks
4. Install all dependencies
5. Add npm scripts to package.json

### Prerequisites

- Project must have `package.json` (run `npm init` first if needed)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] ESLint config exists (`eslint.config.mjs`)
- [ ] Prettier config exists (`.prettierrc.json`)
- [ ] Husky is initialized (`.husky/` directory)
- [ ] Pre-commit hook runs lint-staged
- [ ] `npm run lint` works
- [ ] `npm run format` works

## Testing

Run these commands to verify:
```bash
npm run lint
npm run format:check
npm run type-check
```
